Sending board info to the client

Naïve approach: write the piece along with the associated position on the board (e.g. "bKa1" or "bc8" for pawns), captured pieces are denoted with a sort of mask ("****" or "....")
Total length of string is (16 * 4 (non-pawns)) + (16*3 (pawns)) = 112 characters long

"bKa1wKa5...wc7"

Slightly better (?) approach: write only the non-captured pieces to the client. Any piece that does not show up in the string is considered out of play.
Total length of the string still starts out at 112 characters, but shortens as game progresses

Game information can be sent in a json object like so:

{ "board" : "bKa1..." }

Special conditions (check, checkmate) can be sent in the json body as a separate key

{ "board" : "...", "condition" : "check" }

If need be, can include who's move it is in the object { "board" : "...", "move" : "b" }


Maybe better approach: Split colors down the middle with some delimiter ('|' maybe), ASSUME first set of pieces are white pieces
Total length: (16 * 3 (non-pawns)) + (16 * 2 (pawns)) + 1 = 81 characters long

{ "board" : "Ra1Ba5..g2|Ra8Bb8...", "condition" : "" }


Sending move info to the server

Naive approach (and probably best for this situation): send the move info in algebraic notation (e.g. "wQh2" or "bxc2" for captures)

Client-side checks to see if the move is legal (the piece can move to a certain spot), server checks for the side effects of the move and updates both players

For now, client only sends the move they make
